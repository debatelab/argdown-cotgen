"""
Breadth-first strategy for argument maps.

This strategy reveals all child nodes breadth-first:
1. Reveal nodes level by level (all children before grandchildren)
2. Add YAML and comments

Minimal Test Case:
=================
Input:
```
[Main-1]: Central claim 1.
    <+ <Support A>: First supporter.
        <+ <Sub A1>: Support for A.
        <- <Sub A2>: Attack on A.
    <- <Attack B>: Main attacker.
        <+ <Sub B1>: Support for B.
[Main-2]: Central claim 2.
    <+ <Support C>: First supporter.
        <+ <Sub C1>: Support for C.
        <- <Sub C2>: Attack on C.
```

Expected Output Steps:
- v1: "[Main-1]: Central claim 1. [Main-2]: Central claim 2."
- v2: Add level 1 children: <Support A> and <Attack B> and <Support C>
- v3: Add level 2 children: <Sub A1>, <Sub A2>, <Sub B1>, <Sub C1>, <Sub C2>
- v4: Add YAML and comments (if any)

Note: All nodes at depth n are added before any nodes at depth n+1.
This differs from depth-first which would complete entire branches first.
