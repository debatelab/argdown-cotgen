"""
By-objection strategy for argument maps.

This strategy builds maps by argumentative structure:
1. Roots: Show all root nodes
2. Main supporting argumentation: Show support paths
3. Objections: Add attacking reasons and their supports
4. Rebuttals: Add counter-attacks and their supports
5. Iterate until complete
6. Add YAML and comments

Minimal Test Case:
=================
Input:
```
[Vegetarianism]: People should be vegetarian.
    <+ <Animal Welfare>: Animals suffer in factory farms.
        <+ <Scientific Evidence>: Studies show animal pain.
    <- <Nutrition Concern>: Vegetarian diets lack nutrients.
        <- <Modern Alternatives>: Supplements provide nutrients.
            <+ <Bioavailability>: Modern supplements work well.
        <- <Health Studies>: Vegetarians are healthier.
```

Expected Output Steps:
- v1: Root: "[Vegetarianism]: People should be vegetarian."
- v2: Main supporting argumentation: <Animal Welfare> + <Scientific Evidence> (support chain)
- v3: Objections: <Nutrition Concern> (attacks root, so added with its supports)
- v4: Rebuttals: <Modern Alternatives> + <Bioavailability>, <Health Studies> (attack objection)
- v5: Add YAML and comments (if any)

Note: Groups arguments by their argumentative role rather than structural position.
