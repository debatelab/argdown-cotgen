"""
Random diffusion strategy for argument maps.

This strategy starts with a randomly distorted version and
incrementally removes errors to reach the final correct version.

Minimal Test Case:
=================
Input (Final Correct Version):
```
[Exercise]: Regular exercise is beneficial.
    <+ <Health Benefits>: Exercise improves health.
    <- <Time Constraints>: People lack time for exercise.
```

Expected Output Steps:
- v1: Distorted version with errors:
  ```
  Regular exercise is beneficial.  // Missing label
      -> <Health Benefits>: Exercise improves health.  // Wrong relation
  [Time Constraints]: People lack time for exercise.  // Wrong node type and relation
  ```
- v2: Fix first error (-> should be <+):
  ```
  Regular exercise is beneficial.
      <+ <Health Benefits>: Exercise improves health.
  [Time Constraints]: People lack time for exercise.
  ```
- v3: Fix first error (add label):
  ```
  [Exercise]: Regular exercise is beneficial.
      <+ <Health Benefits>: Exercise improves health.
  [Time Constraints]: People lack time for exercise.
  ```
- v4: Fix second error (place in correct position):
  ```
  [Exercise]: Regular exercise is beneficial.
      <+ <Health Benefits>: Exercise improves health.
      <- [Time Constraints]: People lack time for exercise.
  ```
- v5: Fix third error (make argument):
  ```
  [Exercise]: Regular exercise is beneficial.
      <+ <Health Benefits>: Exercise improves health.
      <- <Time Constraints>: People lack time for exercise.
  ```
- v5: Add YAML and comments (if any)

Note: Starts with systematic distortions (wrong relations, wrong nesting, misisng labels, wrong node types etc.)
and progressively corrects them to demonstrate error-correction reasoning.
