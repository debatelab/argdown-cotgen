"""
Feature-based strategy for individual arguments.

This strategy builds arguments step by step by feature:
1. Title and Gist
2. Final conclusion
3. Premises
4. Intermediate Conclusions
5. Inference information
6. YAML inline data
7. Comments and Misc

Minimal Test Case:
=================
Input:
```
<Moral Argument>: We should protect the environment.

(1) Climate change causes suffering. {certainty: 0.9}
(2) We have a duty to prevent suffering. // Kantian principle
-- modus ponens --
(3) We should act against climate change.
(4) Environmental protection reduces climate change.
-- practical syllogism --
(5) We should protect the environment.
```

Expected Output Steps:
- v1: Title and gist only
- v2: Add premise-conclusion scaffold with final conclusion (5)
- v3: Add all premises (1), (2), (4) 
- v4: Add intermediate conclusion (3)
- v5: Add inference information (modus ponens, practical syllogism)
- v6: Add YAML inline data {certainty: 0.9}
- v7: Add comments // Kantian principle

Notes:
* In each step, propositions are enumerated consecutively.
* Each step may contain preliminary comments like "// inference data needs to be added here"
* Variant: Add title and gist at the very end rather than at the beginning.
